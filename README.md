# KrishiSathi: Empowering Farmers with Smart Technologies

## Team: The Kripples

### Overview
KrishiSathi is a project developed by a dynamic team of B.Tech students in Artificial Intelligence from Kathmandu University, Nepal. Our goal is to assist Nepalese farmers in optimizing farm management, increasing productivity, and maximizing profitability through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

### Key Features
1. **Personalized Dashboard:** We provide a user-friendly interface for farmers to track their income, expenses, and overall farm performance efficiently.
2. **Crop Price Monitoring:** Farmers can access daily crop prices from local markets and trading centers, aiding in informed decision-making regarding sales and purchases.
3. **Livestock Management:** Our platform includes a module for farmers to input and track information about their livestock, such as breed, age, and health status, facilitating better animal care and management.

### Future Prospects
We aim to further enhance KrishiSathi by developing a Computer Vision Model to automate tasks like animal counting, providing even greater support to farmers in their day-to-day activities.

By harnessing the power of AI, we strive to empower farmers and contribute to the growth of Nepal's agricultural sector.
